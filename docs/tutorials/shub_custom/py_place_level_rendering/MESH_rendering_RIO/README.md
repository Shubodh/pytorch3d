What each file does:

1. `python main_render_convexhull_poses.py` renders images at various places as defined by convex hull algorithm and saves it to `temp_dir` directory. See `bash_main_render_convexhull_poses.sh` for example usage.
2. `python main_render_given_poses.py` renders images at original poses given in reference database.
3. `main_save_poses_and_parsers.py` and `main_viz_linspace_poses.py` are for open3d visualization and are to be run locally.
